Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room wanted us to take their adroid app and develop a web based game that is the same as the app that could run on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  Compairing the pros and cons of developing on each of the different platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  By going through the design document it forced me to take the time to go through every detail before actually starting to write code.  By doing this I knew which steps
  should be taken first so it reduced the development time due to mistakes due to rushing through the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would probably revise the evaluation section where I compaired the different operating systems.  I feel like most people already know how they are going to work on 
  any given project and have a preferred operating system so compairing them seems a bit redundent.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  By taking the time to go through the design document I was able to fully understand the needs of the user and develop the class structure that would be needed to run
  a game like this.  It would be very easy to rush into programming and overlook simple needs of the user that would be more obvious if the time was taken to go through
  a design document review.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I first looked over the exact needs that the user had and laid out a plan of attack on how to approach each of the parts that were needed to complete the project.
  The first and most important step is to make sure that I fully understand what the user needs to be completed.  Once I know all of the details of the project then 
  I will take the time to layout each step that needs to be completed.  Then I would build each step making sure they are each functional and then combine them and make
  sure that the project as a whole is functional.
